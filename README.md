## Retreaval Augmented Generation with LLMs and FAST API

Welcome to the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) repository! This project empowers users to perform Question-Answering (QnA) tasks over their own documents using the state-of-the-art RAG technique. By combining open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and FastAPI, we provide a powerful and user-friendly platform for handling document-based QnA.
